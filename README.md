# Project-eBay-Car-Sales
Pandas data analysis

This is project called eBay Car Sales. It's one of the dataquest.io guided project. You can find the data that I used [here](https://query.data.world/s/qhawnnfn6e7ughygt5tjz6xzfhkykk) (encoding='cp1252'). Pandas package was mostly used in this project.

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings. We'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.
